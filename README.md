# Task 1 🏠 House Price Prediction — Linear Regression

This project implements a simple **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on:
- Square footage (`GrLivArea`)
- Number of bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)
- Number of bathrooms (`FullBath`)

---

## 🚀 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## 📈 Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature Selection
3. Model Training (Linear Regression)
4. Model Evaluation (MSE, R²)
5. Visualization of predicted vs actual prices

---

## ⚡ How to run
1. Place the Kaggle dataset in your working directory  
2. Open `# 🏠 House Price Prediction — Linear Regression
